Nice — I’ll walk you through each step in plain, easy language and show a concrete example so you can practice. I’ll cover **how** to do each check, **what to look for**, and **what a real phishing sample might look like**. I’ll finish with a compact checklist you can use every time.

# 1) Obtain a sample phishing email

Simple ways to get practice samples:

* Look for “phishing email samples” on search engines (many security blogs, GitHub repos and training sites provide redacted examples).
* Use intentionally-malicious test emails from phishing-awareness training platforms (if you have access).
* If you have a suspicious email in your own inbox, use that (but don’t click links or open attachments).

**Important:** Do the analysis on a safe machine (or in a sandbox/VM) if attachments are present. Never open attachments or click links directly.

# 2) Examine the sender’s email address for spoofing

**What to do**

1. Look at the visible “From” address in the email client (e.g., `From: support@bank-example.com`).
2. Click/inspect the address to see the full email (some clients show a friendly name plus the real address).
3. Ask: does the domain match the organization? (e.g., `@bank-example.com` vs `@bank-example-support.com`)

**Examples**

* Legit-looking but **spoofed**: `From: Bank Support <support@bank-example.com>` — but the actual address may be `support@bank-example-support.com` or `support@randomdomain.xyz`.
* Look for subtle typos: `paypa1.com` (one is the digit `1`) vs `paypal.com`.

**Red flags**

* Domain is different from the organization name.
* Extra words, hyphens, or different TLDs (`.ru`, `.xyz`, `.co` instead of `.com`).
* Email uses public domains for official business (`@gmail.com`, `@yahoo.com` for a company support address).

# 3) Check email headers for discrepancies (use an analyzer)

Email headers contain routing and authentication info (Received lines, SPF/DKIM/DMARC results). Steps:

**How to view headers** (common clients)

* **Gmail (web):** Open message → three-dot menu → “Show original”.
* **Outlook (desktop):** File → Properties → Internet headers.
* **Thunderbird:** View → Message Source.

**What to look for (key header fields)**

* `Received:` lines — show the mail servers the message passed through (bottom-most `Received` is the origin).
* `Return-Path:` — where bounces go; if it doesn’t match sender, suspicious.
* `Authentication-Results:` — shows SPF/DKIM/DMARC evaluation (pass/fail/neutral).
* `From:` vs `Reply-To:` — `Reply-To` may be set to a different address.
* `Message-ID:` — legitimate providers use consistent formats; odd or missing IDs can be suspicious.

**Example (short header snippet)**

```
Return-Path: <support@bank-example-support.com>
Received: from smtp123.somehost.ru (unknown [203.0.113.45]) by mx.google.com ...
Received-SPF: fail (google.com: domain of bank-example.com does not designate 203.0.113.45 as permitted sender)
Authentication-Results: mx.google.com;
    spf=fail (google.com: domain of bank-example.com does not permit this IP) smtp.mailfrom=bank-example.com;
    dkim=neutral (no signature)
From: "Bank of Example" <support@bank-example.com>
Reply-To: support@bank-example-support.com
```

**How to interpret**

* `Received-SPF: fail` — the sending IP is not authorised by the sender’s domain SPF record → suspicious.
* `dkim=neutral` or `dkim=fail` — the DKIM signature is missing/invalid → suspicious.
* If `From:` domain and `Return-Path` or `Reply-To` differ, that’s suspicious.

**Tip:** After reading headers you can paste them into an “email header analyzer” (many free tools exist) to get a parsed, readable output.

# 4) Identify suspicious links or attachments

**Links**

* **Hover** over links (desktop) to see the actual URL shown in the browser status bar (or right-click → “Copy link address”).
* Compare the visible text vs the real link. Example: link text `https://bank-example.com/login` but real URL `http://123.45.67.89/~bank/login.php` or `http://bank-example.secure-login.ru/login`.
* Look for long URLs with many subfolders, IP addresses, or strange domains.

**Attachments**

* See the filename and extension (`.exe`, `.zip`, `.scr`, `.docm`, `.js` are high risk).
* If the email claims an invoice/receipt but attachment is `.exe` → definitely malicious.
* If you must check an attachment, upload it to a sandbox/virus scanner service (do not open locally on your PC).

**Example**

* Email text: “Click here to verify your account: [https://bank-example.com/verify”](https://bank-example.com/verify”)
* Hover reveals: `http://account.verify-bank-example.com/login.php?id=1245` pointing to a foreign domain — suspicious.

---

# 5) Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body

Phishers try to create panic or urgency so you act without thinking.

**Phrases to watch**

* “Your account will be closed in 24 hours”
* “Immediate action required”
* “Verify now to avoid suspension”
* “You have won — claim now” (for scam/spam)

**What to do**

* Treat all urgent threats as suspicious. Real companies rarely force immediate login via email; they usually allow multiple notice channels and never ask for credentials by email.

---

# 6) Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link)

This is a repeat of #4 but with focus on mismatch.

**Quick test**

* If the display text looks like a legitimate domain but the hover URL is different — RED FLAG.
* If the link uses URL shorteners (`bit.ly`, `tinyurl`) in suspicious contexts (e.g., bank) — expand the short link before opening.

**How to expand short links**

* Copy the shortened link and put it in a short-link previewer or paste into a text box that shows the final URL, or paste into a browser address bar but do not press Enter — many preview sites exist.

---

# 7) Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors

Phishing emails often have awkward wording, spelling mistakes, or bad punctuation.

**Examples**

* “Dear Valued Costumer” (typo)
* Strange capitalization: “Please Click Here To Update”
* Odd sentence structure or literal translations

**Note:** Some phishers are good at English. Absence of errors ≠ safe.

---

# 8) Summarize phishing traits found in the email (how to make a summary)

After you inspect everything, make a short summary listing all suspicious traits.

**Example phishing email (full sample)**

Subject: Urgent: Verify Your Bank Account Now

From: Bank of Example [support@bank-example.com](mailto:support@bank-example.com)
Reply-To: [security@bank-example-support.com](mailto:security@bank-example-support.com)

Body:

> Dear Customer,
> We detected a suspicious login to your account. You must verify your information within 24 hours otherwise your account will be suspended.
> Click here to verify: [https://bank-example.com/verify](https://bank-example.com/verify)
> Thank you,
> Bank of Example Security Team

Attachment: `Statement.exe`

**Analysis & summary**

* **Sender address mismatch:** `From` shows `support@bank-example.com` but `Reply-To` and `Return-Path` are different (`bank-example-support.com`) → suspicious.
* **Header problems:** SPF fail; DKIM missing/invalid; `Received:` shows origin IP from a foreign host not associated with the bank → suspicious.
* **Link mismatch:** Displayed link looks like bank domain but actually points to unknown IP / different domain → suspicious.
* **Attachment risky:** `Statement.exe` — executable attachment masquerading as a statement → high risk.
* **Urgency:** “verify within 24 hours” — typical phishing pressure.
* **Grammar/spelling:** maybe okay — absence of errors doesn’t clear it.
* **Conclusion:** This is almost certainly a phishing email. Do not click links or run the attachment.

# Additional safety steps & recommended actions

1. **Do NOT click links or open attachments.**
2. Forward the phishing email to your IT/security team or to the organization being impersonated (many companies have `abuse@` or `phishing@` addresses).
3. Mark the message as spam/phishing in your email client.
4. If you clicked a link or gave credentials, immediately change your password on the real site (not via the emailed link) and enable MFA. Notify the organization.
5. Save the original email (headers included) for investigation.

# Quick checklist (for everyday use)

* [ ] Inspect full sender email (not only the display name).
* [ ] View headers: check SPF/DKIM/DMARC and Received chain.
* [ ] Hover/copy links to verify real URLs; don’t click.
* [ ] Don’t open attachments — especially `.exe`, `.zip`, `.scr`, `.docm`.
* [ ] Watch for urgency, threats, or requests for passwords/2FA codes.
* [ ] Check spelling/grammar — but don’t rely solely on it.
* [ ] If suspicious, report and delete.

If you want, I can:

* parse a **specific** suspicious email header you paste here (redact any personal info) and explain each header line; **OR**
* create a printable one-page checklist/infographic for quick reference.
