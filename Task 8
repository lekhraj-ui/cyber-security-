## Findings

### Benefits ‚úÖ

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enhanced Privacy** | Hides real IP from websites and ISP |
| **Public Wi-Fi Security** | Encrypts traffic on untrusted networks |
| **Bypass Restrictions** | Access geo-blocked content and services |
| **Remote Access** | Secure connection to internal resources |

### Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Reduced Speed** | Encryption overhead decreases performance |
| **Trust Requirements** | Free VPNs may compromise privacy |
| **Partial Anonymity** | Cookies and fingerprinting still track users |
| **Service Blocks** | Streaming platforms detect and block VPNs |
| **Legal Restrictions** | VPN use illegal in some jurisdictions |

## Conclusion

Proton VPN's free plan provides a legitimate, secure option for basic VPN needs with unlimited data and strong privacy protections. However, users should be aware of:

- **Performance trade-offs** for enhanced security
