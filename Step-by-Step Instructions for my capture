You're right! The export option might be named differently. Here are all the possible locations and names for exporting as PCAP:

## Alternative Export Locations in Wireshark

### **Method 1: File Menu Options**

**Look for these exact menu items:**
```
File → Export Specified Packets...
File → Save As...
File → Export Packet Dissections → As PCAP...
```

### **Method 2: Right-Click Method**
```
1. Select any packet in the list
2. Right-click → Export Packet Dissections → As PCAP...
```

### **Method 3: Keyboard Shortcuts**
```
Ctrl + S  (Save As)
```

## If You Still Can't Find PCAP Export

### **Solution 1: Use "Save As" Instead**
```
1. File → Save As
2. In "Save as type" dropdown, select:
   - *.pcap
   - *.pcapng (newer format, also acceptable)
   - *.cap
```

### **Solution 2: Command Line Export**
If the GUI isn't working, use command line:

```bash
# Convert existing file to pcap
editcap -F pcap input_file.pcapng output_file.pcap

# Or capture directly to pcap
dumpcap -i "Wi-Fi" -w capture.pcap -a duration:60
```

### **Solution 3: Use tshark (Command Line)**
```bash
# Direct capture to pcap file (no GUI needed)
tshark -i "Wi-Fi" -w my_capture.pcap -a duration:60

# Generate traffic while capturing
tshark -i "Wi-Fi" -w traffic.pcap &
ping google.com
curl http://example.com
nslookup facebook.com
# Wait 60 seconds, then stop with Ctrl+C
```

## Step-by-Step Workaround

### **If No Export Option Exists:**

**Option A: Use "Save As"**
```
1. File → Save As
2. File name: "my_capture"
3. Save as type: "Wireshark/tcpdump/... - pcap"
4. Click Save
```

**Option B: Use "Export Specified Packets"**
```
1. File → Export Specified Packets...
2. Check "All packets" or "Selected packets only"
3. Output file: "my_capture.pcap"
4. Save as type: "pcap" or "pcapng"
```

## Complete Command Line Method (Guaranteed to Work)

### **Step 1: Capture with tshark**
```bash
# Open Command Prompt as Administrator
tshark -i "Wi-Fi" -w capture.pcap -a duration:60
```

### **Step 2: Generate Traffic in New Window**
```bash
# Open another Command Prompt
ping -n 10 google.com
ping -n 10 8.8.8.8
curl http://www.example.com
nslookup youtube.com
```

### **Step 3: Verify Capture File**
```bash
# After 60 seconds, tshark auto-stops
# Check if file was created:
dir *.pcap

# Read the capture file:
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "dns or http or tcp or icmp"
```

## Wireshark Version Differences

- **Older versions**: Use "Save As" → "pcap"
- **Newer versions**: Use "Export Packet Dissections" → "As PCAP"
- **Wireshark 3.0+**: Both options should work

## Quick Verification

After exporting, verify your file:
```bash
# Check file format
capinfos capture.pcap

# Read packets
tshark -r capture.pcap -c 10
```

## If All Else Fails - Use Pre-Built Command Script

Create a batch file `capture.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting 60-second capture...
tshark -i "Wi-Fi" -w my_traffic.pcap -a duration:60
echo Capture complete! File: my_traffic.pcap
